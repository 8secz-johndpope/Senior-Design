# Senior-Design

Prereqs
1. Set up the github with folder for each problem

2. Design before we code

Problem 1

-Duplicate language/sentences-

Copyleaks python api 

Problem 2

-Return/profit related language-

**not sure how to implement

Problem 4

-Fake team picture or profile-

Scrape images (with names) from pdf -> upload to server using gyazo -> get url from gyazo and enter that into 
a reverse image search through google -> scrape the results off google (trying to verify face with name) -> if no matching name raise a red flag, if some names match and others don't raise suspicion

If whitepaper has no pictures, take the names -> use social media apis to verify the name
